# See Bobo do [Cryptopals](https://cryptopals.com/) again after all these years...

## Backstory

I got through set four, but after set 2, I was asked to stop pushing my code to GitHub. At the time I did not have a paid personal account so I could not simply make the repo private. As a result, I have long since lost all of my solutions.

Lately I've been rather bored and looking for something to do that isn't going to be a huge time sink, so I'm dusting this off, tidying it up and starting again. Wish me luck!
